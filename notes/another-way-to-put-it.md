# Another way to put it

[Alternative Big-O notations](https://twitter.com/jwcarroll/status/1114576190247976960)

```text
O(1) = O(yeah)
O(log n) = O(nice)
O(n) = O(ok)
O(n²) = O(my)
O(2ⁿ) = O(no)
O(n!) = O(mg!)
```

[Technical Observability](https://twitter.com/mipsytipsy/status/1295606425280946176)

```text
high cardinality
high dimensionality
wide, rich events (aka spans)
schemas are inferred and dynamic
no friction to adding more context
unique ids, propagated
SLOs
tracing
column store or autoindexed
very near realtime
```
