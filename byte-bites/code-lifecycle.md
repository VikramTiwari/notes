# Code lifecycle

`maintainer > author` Code is read more than written

`user > maintainer > author` Code is used more than read

`user > ops > dev` Code is run more than read

`biz > user > ops > dev` Code has to be for a business

`author > maintainer` Code is unmaintainable

`dev > user` Unusable software

`dev > ops` Works on my machine

`dev > biz` Not the right thing

`dev > *` Resume driven development

`biz > user > -ops- > dev` Imaginary software

`biz > -user- > ops > dev` Also imaginary software

`biz > user > ops > dev` Late capitalism

`biz > user`: An elephant
