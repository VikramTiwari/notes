# Software Development Waste

These findings may not generalize, but the taxonomy is still a valuable checklist for any team that's trying to figure out how to be more efficient.

| Waste | Description | Observed Causes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Building the wrong feature or product | The cost of building a feature or product that does not address user or business needs. | User desiderata \(not doing user research, validation, or testing; ignoring user feedback; working on low user value features\) Business desiderata \(not involving a business stakeholder; slow stakeholder feedback; unclear product priorities\) |
| Mismanaging the backlog | The cost of duplicating work, expediting lower value user features, or delaying necessary bug fixes. | Backlog inversion Working on too many features simultaneously Duplicated work Not enough ready stories Imbalance of feature work and bug fixing Delaying testing or critical bug fixing Capricious thrashing |
| Rework | The cost of altering delivered work that should have been done correctly but was not. | Technical debt Rejected stories \(e.g. product manager rejects story implementation\) No clear definition of done \(ambiguous stories; second-guessing design mocks\) Defects \(poor testing strategy; no root-cause analysis on bugs\) |
| Unnecessarily complex solutions | The cost of creating a more complicated solution than necessary, a missed opportunity to simplify features, user interface, or code. | Unnecessary feature complexity from the userâ€™s perspective Unnecessary technical complexity \(duplicating code, lack of interaction design reuse, an overly complex technical design created up-front\) |
| Extraneous cognitive load | The costs of unneeded expenditure of mental energy. | Suffering from technical debt Complex or large stories Inefficient tools and problematic APIs, libraries, and frameworks Unnecessary context switching Inefficient development flow Poorly organized code |
| Psychological distress | The costs of burdening the team with unhelpful stress. | Low team morale Rush mode Interpersonal or team conflict |
| Waiting/multitasking | The cost of idle time, often hidden by multi-tasking. | Slow tests or unreliable tests Unreliable acceptance environment Missing information, people, or equipment Context switching from delayed feedback |
| Knowledge loss | The cost of re-acquiring information that the team once knew. | Team churn Knowledge silos |
| Ineffective communication | The cost of incomplete, incorrect, misleading, inefficient, or absent communication. | The team size is too large Asynchronous communication \(distributed teams; distributed stakeholders; dependency on another team; opaque processes outside the team\) Imbalance \(dominating the conversation; not listening\) Inefficient meetings \(lack of focus; skipping retros; not discussing blockers each day; meetings running over \(e.g. long stand-ups\)\) |
