Build docker images and push to container registry

```bash
# authentication for docker
# from https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/docs/advanced-authentication
gcloud auth configure-docker

# build a docker image locally and push to GCP container registry
docker build -t gcr.io/ivikramtiwari/website:latest .
gcloud docker -- push gcr.io/omni-daeos-runner/website:latest

# or just use cloud builds which will automatically store the image in registry
gcloud builds submit --timeout 2h --tag gcr.io/ivikramtiwari/website:latest .

# pull image for usage
gcloud docker -- pull gcr.io/ivikramtiwari/website:latest

# -- (double dashes) are used to pass parameters to docker.
# If advanced authentication is set up properly, you can skip using 
# gcloud docker
# and just use
# docker
```

More commands for quick usage

```bash
# copy files from a VM to local
gcloud compute scp --recurse my-vm://home/vikramtheone1/my-files/ ./ --zone=us-central1-b
